## Hi👋, I'm Janis Kwun Gee Chan 😄

  - ✨ I've been starting to code for around 3 years since my first repository was built.
  - 🖥️ I've been using 3 languages to build my projects, Javascript, GO and Python. And I like 👍 all of them. 
  - 🏫 I'm starting to learn Typescript at the moment. 
  - 😁 You can visit my [portfolio](https://janis-chan-portfolio-jc.netlify.app/) web page to know me a bit more!
