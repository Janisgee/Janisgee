## Hi👋, I'm Janis Kwun Gee Chan 😄

  - ✨ I've been starting to code for around 3 years since my first repository was built.
  - 🖥️ I've been using 3 languages to build my projects, Javascript, GO and Python. And I like 👍 all of them. 
  - 🏫 I'm starting to learn Typescript at the moment. 
  - 😁 You can visit my [portfolio](https://janis-chan-portfolio-jc.netlify.app/) web page to know me a bit more!

## I would like to say ...
  - 💃🏻 I've been enjoying web development for the first ever since I built my first JavaScript project "Weather App". I enjoyed a lot that I can get information throught fetching API request and             stored the details in the position I want. I was actually created something and it was very useful.
  - 🔎 I'm currently on the look out for a role in junior software development, ideally writing JavaScript, Go or Python. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can           make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
